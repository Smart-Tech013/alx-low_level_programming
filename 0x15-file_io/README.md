File Input and Output, often referred to as file I/O, is a fundamental concept in C programming. It allows you to read data from and write data to external files. This is essential when you need to work with data that's stored beyond the scope of your program's runtime, such as text files, configuration files, or binary data files.

Why Use File I/O?
File I/O is used for various purposes:

Data Persistence: You can save data to files so it persists even after the program exits. This is crucial for applications that need to store user preferences, game progress, or database records.

Data Sharing: Files enable data sharing between different programs or instances of the same program. For example, one program can generate a report in a file, and another program can read and process that report.

Large Data Handling: Files are useful for handling large datasets that may not fit into memory all at once.

Data Backup: You can create backups of important data by writing it to files.
