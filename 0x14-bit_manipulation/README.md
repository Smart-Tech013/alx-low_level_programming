Bit manipulation in C involves manipulating individual bits within integer values using bitwise operators. This technique is often used for tasks such as setting, clearing, toggling, or extracting specific bits in an integer. Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in low-level programming and is commonly used in embedded systems, device drivers, and various other applications where precise control over individual bits is required.

Here are the common bitwise operators used for bit manipulation in C:

Bitwise AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding bits of two integers. It sets a bit to 1 if both input bits are 1.

Bitwise OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation between corresponding bits of two integers. It sets a bit to 1 if either of the input bits is 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation between corresponding bits of two integers. It sets a bit to 1 if the input bits are different.

Bitwise NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation on an integer, inverting all its bits.

Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the vacant positions with zeros.

Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions. The behavior depends on whether it's an arithmetic or logical right shift.
